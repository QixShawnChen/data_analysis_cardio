# Proposals
I would like to do a data analysis project related to heart disease with python. I am trying to find a suitable dataset now. The project is trying to find the most suitable training model for the dataset.
1. 	Firstly, I will do an exploratory data analysis to the dataset to grab the basic information for each variable.
2. 	I guess the output variable will be just a dummy variable. 0 represents non-cardiac disease. 1 represents cardiac disease.
3. 	The dataset will be separated into a training set and a test set.
4. 	Try to train the model with logistic regression with the training dataset. Before doing this, I will check the level of multicollinearity between variables. Then, ridge or lasso might be applied to deal with that and also to reduce the model complexity.
5. 	Besides the logistic regression, random forests, boosting, support vector machine, KNN, and neural network models will be trained.
6. 	A most suitable model will be selected by comprehensive consideration, including interpretation, accuracy, and complexity.
7. 	From the models generated, the factors that will increase the odds of getting heart disease will be found out.


# TO-DO List
1. 	By the end of week 4, I will confirm the dataset to use, and finish data cleaning. For the missing values, I might need some time to think of how to deal with them, deleting generally is not a good idea, but unreasonable imputation might lead to an even worse result.
 
2. 	By the end of week 5, the exploratory data analysis has to be finished, including obtaining the basic properties like means, variances, standard deviation of each continuous variables, and counts of each dummy or categorical variables, how their values are distributed (maybe by using histogram or bar plot).  The dataset will be separated into a training set and a test set.  The first model to train will be determined by the multicollinearity level (basically by the correlation plot of the training set).
 
3. 	By the end of week 6, the models to be trained should be decided and start doing the model training work. The framework of the project should be completed.
 
4. 	By the end of week 7, there should be an almost-finished data analysis project. All the models like random forest, adaboost, MARS, SVM, and PCR, etc. (just list some possible models. Not sure now) should be finished and start revising the project.
 
5. 	By the end of week 8, everything of the project has to be finished including the programming work, interpretation, and the corresponding report. I will start contacting our instructor and TAs for some improvement advice and update for the last version.
